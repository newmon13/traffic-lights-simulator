## About

## Requirements
- [ ] Executing specific action on crossroad based on a command read from input file
- [ ] Simulator should work in similar way to real traffic light systems
- [ ] Simulator should take in consideration traffic volume
- [ ] Simulator should have basic modes (green, yellow, red) plus extra green arrow mode
- [ ] Should provide secure way of cars movement by for example avoiding conflict situations such as green light for both roads at the same time
- [ ] Should track number of cars waiting on each row and waiting for green light
- [ ] App should run with single command that takes **input** JSON file and **output** JSON file as arguments

Nice to have:
- [ ] Several roads on each side of crossroad
- [ ] Different modes of lights work
- [ ] Prioritizing of specific roads
- [ ] Pedestriants
- [ ] System failure simulation
- [ ] Edge cases validation
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Description of traffic algorithm in readme.md
- [ ] Good codebase structure
- [ ] Efficiency of algorithm
- [ ] Code readability
- [ ] Implementing additional features
